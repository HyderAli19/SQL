#TYPES OF NORMALIZATION:=


4 TYPES ARE THERE....
 
 THEY ARE :=\

1> 1NF
2> 2NF
3> 3NF
4> BOYCE CODE NORMAL FORM...




CONSIDER A RAW DATA OF EMPLOYEE-PROJECT DETAILS..

      P_NO      P_NAME      ENO     ENAME     RATING     HOURLY CHARGED
      1001   JAVA PROJECT   10      SOUMYA       A            100
                            20       RAVI        B             90
                            30       KIRAN       C             80
                            40       RAHUL       D             70
     
    1002  PYTHOH PROJECT    15       VIJAY       E             60
                            10       SOUMYA      A             100

   
 THE ABOVE DATA NOT IN A TABLE FORMAT. WE CAN CONVERT IT INTO TABLE FORMAT WITHOUT USING CURD OPERTION.
 
  WITH THE HELP OF NORMALIZATION PROCESS WE CAN CONVERT THE RAW DATA INTO TABLE FORMAT......



1> 1NF:= A TABLE SHOULD IN 1NF WHEN IT HAVE
            EACH ATTRIBTE SHOULD HAVE SEPARATE COLUNMS
               EVERY CELL SHOULD BE ATOMIC
                     ATOMIC REFERS SHOULD HAVE ONLY ONE VALUE IN ONE CELL....

THE TABULAR FORMMAT OF ABOVE RAW DATA BY USING 1NF IF:=




      P_NO      P_NAME      ENO     ENAME     RATING     HOURLY CHARGED
      1001   JAVA PROJECT   10      SOUMYA       A            100
      1001   JAVA PROJECT   20       RAVI        B             90
      1001   JAVA PROJECT   30       KIRAN       C             80
      1001   JAVA PROJECT   40       RAHUL       D             70
      1002  PYTHOH PROJECT  15       VIJAY       E             60
      1002  PYTHOH PROJECT  10       SOUMYA      A             100



2> 2NF:=  A TABLE SHOULD BE IN 2NF WHEN IT HAVE
             FORMAT OF 1NF...
               DOES NOT HAE PARTIAL DEPENDENCY...

FROM THE WE CAN SAY THAT P_NAME DEEND ON P_NO AND ENAME DEPENDS ON ENO WHICH CREATE AN PARTIAL DEPENDENCY....
TO OER COME IT WE CAN USE 2NF. THE RESULT TABLE IS 
  

  EMPLOYEE:=               ENO     ENAME     RATING     HOURLY CHARGED              PROJECT:=
                            10      SOUMYA       A            100
                            20       RAVI        B             90                          P_NO        P_NAME
                            30       KIRAN       C             80                          1001       JAVA PROJECT

                            10       SOUMYA      A            100



PROJECT_EMPLOYEE:=
       P_NO      E_NO

       1002      15
       1002      10




3>  3NF:=  IF TABLE IN 3NF THEN IT SHOULD HAVE 
               SHOULD BE IN 2NF....
                 AND SHOULD HAVE TRANSISTIVE DEPENDENCY....

FROM ABOVE TABLE IN 2NF TABLES WE CAN SEE THERE IS TRANSISTIVE DEPENDENCY.....
        

               TRANSISTIVE DEPENDECY== HOURLY CHARGES DEPEDED ON RATING AND RATING DEPEND ON ENO
                                    THEN HOURLY CHARGES ARE EPEND ON RATING....


RESULTED TABLES ARE:=

        ALL DETERMINENT SHOULD BE KEYS(PRIMARY KEYS)

             PROJECT_EMPLOYEE HAS BOTH P_NO AND E_NO PRIMARY KEYS(DETERMINENT)..........
                  EMPLOYEE HAS ENO AS PRIMARY KEY(DETERMINENT)..........
