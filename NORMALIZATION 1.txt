  NORMALIZATION:=
    
    NORMALIZATION IS A PROCESS OF DECOMPOSING OR SPILITING THE TABLE TO SOLVE OR RESOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS....
  
=> DECOMPOSING IS TECHNICAL WORD OF SPILITING.

PROBLEMS ARE THREE TYPES:=

1>SUPIRIOUS TUPLES OR SUPIROUS ROWS
              
                  TUPLES = ROWS
              THSI IS A TYPE OF WHERE THEY ARE SOME UNWANTED ROWS ARE PRESENT....

2>ANOMOLIES:=
  MEANS PROBLEM 
  TECHNICAL WORD OF PROBLEM IS ANOMOLIES
ANOMOLIES LIKE:=
           INSERTING ANOMOLIES
           UPDATE ANOMOLIES
           DELETE ANOMOLIES


3>DATA REDUNDANCY:=
      REPETATION OF SAME DATA IN A DIFFERENT ROWS OF A TABLE....




DEPENDENCIES:=
  

  1> FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY = IF AN ATTRIBUTE DEPEND ON ANOTHER ATTRIBUTE....
          CONIDER A TABLE WITH ST_ID AND ST_NAME. 
              HERE ST_NAME IS DEPENDENT ON ST_ID WHERE ST_ID IS DETERMINENT AND ST_NAME IS DEPENDENT.....

   
  2>PARTIAL DEPENDENCY = CONTAIN MORE THAN ONE DETERMINENT IN A DATA SET...
                             ASLO WE CAN OBSERVE CANDIDATE KEY IN PARTIAL DEPENDENCY TABLE.......
                                  CANDIDATE KEY CAN BE DEFINED AS THE COMBONINATION TWO NON PRIMARY KEYS.....

  3>TRANSISTIVE DEPENDENCY = WHEN AN INDIRECT REALTION CAUSE FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY THEN IT IS CALLED TRANSISTIVE DEPENDENCY....
                    IN SIMPLE MANNER=
                                   X->Y AND Y->Z
                                        THEN
                                        X->Z
